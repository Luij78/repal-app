### Subsection 3: Property Management Violations

**Overview:** The Commission deals with an increasing number of property management violation cases. With sales associates, these typically involve licensees acting as investors OR beyond scope.

**Licensees who act as investors or beyond the scope of a sales associate:**

**(Slide 1) Licensee acting as an investor:**
- If acting as investor, licensee must ensure **ALL PARTIES ARE AWARE** they are **NOT acting as a real estate licensee**
- **Example Case:** Individual acting as investor gave out business cards/stationary indicating they were a licensee → Commission ruled they WERE acting as a licensee, not investor

**• Licensee acting in the capacity of an investor:**
- A licensee CAN act as a private investor
- **HOWEVER:** If the licensee leads the public to believe they're dealing in a real estate brokerage transaction, AND the other party is damaged/harmed → that party may collect from the **Real Estate Recovery Fund**
- Result: **Automatic suspension** to the licensee

**• Licensee acting beyond the scope of a sales associate:**
- A sales associate may **ONLY receive compensation from their employing broker**
- Cannot receive compensation from any other source regarding real estate transactions

**Example Case:**
- Sales associate's broker doesn't handle property management
- Sales associate sets up their OWN company to handle property management
- **Result:** Found GUILTY of operating as a broker while licensed as a sales associate
